        <b>Abstract:</b> Hyperacusis Research, Limited, inc. is a non-profit
        charity dedicated to the development of effective treatments for
        hyperacusis and to funding research which will eliminate the underlying
        mechanisms that cause hyperacusis. Our foundation is dedicated to
        improving the quality of life for patients who suffer from hyperacusis
        and hyperacusis related disorders. Central to the mission of our
        organization is facilitating and supporting biomedical research which
        will lead to novel and effective therapies for Hyperacusis. We also
        provide information to those individuals with Hyperacusis that may help
        with their understanding of this disorder through various websites and
        organizations affiliated with our cause. Throughout our existence we
        have partnered with the Hearing Health Foundation. Money raised by our
        organization has helped fund several scientific research projects which
        might one day lead us to an effective therapy. The purpose of this
        presentation at TRI 2024 is to familiarize the audience with our cause.
