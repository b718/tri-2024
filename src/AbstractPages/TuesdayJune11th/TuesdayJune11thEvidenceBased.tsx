        <b>Abstract:</b> What is the best treatment option for my patient and
        how can I find evidence about it? This workshop will be an introduction
        to evidence-based practice in audiology and overview the 5 steps to find
        and appraise evidence from published research. More specifically, 1) how
        to ask an answerable question, 2) to conduct an efficient search of the
        literature, 3) appraise the quality of evidence, 4) decide how the
        evidence applies to this particular patient, and 5) evaluate the outcome
        of the treatment and seek ways to improve next time.
