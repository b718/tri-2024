        <b>Abstract:</b> In this presentation, I will present the hypothesis, as
        well as the data collected in patients, suggesting that the middle ear
        (especially the middle ear muscles) and the multimodal plasticity can
        account for specific sub- types of tinnitus and hyperacusis.Â  I will
        also present the tools and approaches that can be used to assess the
        middle ear function, including a sensor pressure device that we have
        developed to objectify the tensor tympani contraction.
