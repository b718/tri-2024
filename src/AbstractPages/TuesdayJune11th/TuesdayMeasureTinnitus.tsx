        <b>Abstract:</b> In the Clinic, measuring tinnitus helps the patient
        understand it is real, and distinguishes the 1) Tinnitus from the 2)
        Reactions to Tinnitus (The Psychological Model). Loudness and pitch
        ratings are straightforward, and masking the tinnitus can be useful for
        directing sound therapy. The Tinnitus Primary Functions Questionnaire
        determines which areas are needed for counselingâ€¦.1) Thoughts and
        Emotions, 2) Hearing, 3) Sleep and/or 4) Concentration, in Tinnitus
        Activities Treatment. There are many subtypes of tinnitus, that are
        evident when measuring masking, post-masking effects, and post-masking
        recovery. There is now a greater appreciation that there are different
        subgroups of tinnitus patients, and the careful selection of subgroups
        needed to be applied to drug and other treatment trials.
