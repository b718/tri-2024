        <b>One Sentence Summary:</b> The development of a new set of outcome
        measures – which are statistically rigorous, transparent, and reflect
        patient expectations – is required to meaningfully assess the success of
        tinnitus trials and interventions.

        <b>Abstract:</b> Most clinical trials for tinnitus use the Tinnitus
        Functional Index (TFI) or Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) to measure
        success. Both of these are standardized questionnaires taken at various
        points before, during, and after an intervention. But how reliable and
        valid are these metrics as outcome measures? What are the right and
        wrong applications of these metrics? And what do they truly represent in
        terms of patient outcomes in the real world? Specifically, some of the
        downsides of using the TFI/THI are: - From a statistical perspective,
        TFI/THI should be used to determine sample sizes, not necessarily to
        measure improvement. - Thresholds for &#39;clinical significance&#39; do
        not reflect a sizable improvement and thus can lead to misleading
        communication and marketing of trial results. - Certain aspects of
        tinnitus that patients care about, such as the variability of one&#39;s
        tinnitus, are not reflected in the TFI/THI. - We know from patient
        engagement (e.g. surveys) that patients expect a tinnitus intervention
        to reduce the loudness of their tinnitus. Continuing use of the TFI/THI,
        which mostly reflect distress, detracts from the need to target and
        measure loudness reduction. - It is questionable, overall, whether
        TFI/THI meaningfully reflect patient improvement, vis-à-vis for instance
        simply asking the patient &quot;how much did this intervention help
        you?&quot; In sum, the development of a new set of outcome measures is
        required to meaningfully assess the success of tinnitus trials and
        interventions. These outcome measures need to be statistically rigorous,
        transparent, and reflect patient expectations.
