        <b>Abstract:</b> Science shows us that several physical symptoms or
        dysfunctions may be present in patients with tinnitus. In this
        symposium, we aim to give a broad view of which physical symptoms might
        influence patients&#39; tinnitus and how we can treat them. Because
        physical symptoms are very common, also in people without tinnitus, the
        second aim of this symposium is to give insight into the prevalence of a
        series of physical symptoms in a tinnitus population compared to the
        general population. Treatment of the cervical spine or temporomandibular
        area is possible in many different ways and can have a positive effect
        on tinnitus severity. Therefore, the third aim of this symposium is to
        give insight into different therapies that can be applied in patients
        with somatosensory tinnitus and to show the effectiveness of these
        therapies on patients&#39; tinnitus severity. The other way around, we
        know several patients with somatosensory tinnitus who were cured of
        their tinnitus after cervical spine or temporomandibular treatment. The
        final goal of this symposium is to present the characteristics of these
        patients and the type of treatment that provided succor.
