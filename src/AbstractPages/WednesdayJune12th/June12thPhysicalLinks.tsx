        Science shows us that several physical symptoms or dysfunctions may be
        present in patients with tinnitus. In this symposium, we aim to give a
        broad view of which physical symptoms might influence patients' tinnitus
        and how we can treat them. Because physical symptoms are very common,
        also in people without tinnitus, the second aim of this symposium is to
        give insight into the prevalence of a series of physical symptoms in a
        tinnitus population compared to the general population.

        Treatment of the cervical spine or temporomandibular area is possible in
        many different ways and can have a positive effect on tinnitus severity.
        Therefore, the third aim of this symposium is to give insight into
        different therapies that can be applied in patients with somatosensory
        tinnitus and to show the effectiveness of these therapies on patients'
        tinnitus severity. The other way around, we know several patients with
        somatosensory tinnitus who were cured of their tinnitus after cervical
        spine or temporomandibular treatment. The final goal of this symposium
        is to present the characteristics of these patients and the type of
        treatment that provided succor.
