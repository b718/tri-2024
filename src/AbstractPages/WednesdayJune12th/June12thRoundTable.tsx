        Since tinnitus is a symptom that can arise from different etiologies
        (e.g., noise trauma, aging, brain injury), in this session experts will
        discuss whether there is enough evidence to distinguish subtypes of
        tinnitus, and why it would be wise to do so. Different point of views
        from both clinicians and researchers will be presented and the attendees
        will be invited to join the discussion and ask questions.
