        <b>Abstract:</b> Oticon has been at the forefront of integrating
        tinnitus sound support into its diverse range of hearing aid models
        since 2014. This workshop aims to illuminate the advanced features
        embedded within Oticon&#39;s Tinnitus Sound Support. Participants will
        also gain insight into the comprehensive suite of resources developed to
        empower both clinicians and patients in the effective management of
        tinnitus. This workshop will explore Tinnitus Sound Support in the Genie
        2.0 programming software. Attendees will receive guidance in navigating
        the software&#39;s capabilities, specifically focusing on the
        customization of tinnitus relief sounds. With four broadband noises and
        three calming, ocean-like sounds, clinicians can fine-tune these options
        to suit the individual needs of each patient, fostering a personalized
        and effective intervention for ear-level sound support. There will also
        be a demonstration of Oticon&#39;s innovative Companion App, which puts
        some control directly in the hands of users. Participants will discover
        how this user-friendly app enables real-time adjustments, providing
        individuals with the flexibility to tailor their tinnitus relief sounds
        on the go. By the end of this workshop, participants will leave with a
        deepened understanding of Oticon&#39;s Tinnitus Sound Support,
        proficiency in using the Genie 2.0 programming software, and insights
        into leveraging the Companion App for enhanced user experiences. They
        will also be provided hardcopies of clinician and patient tinnitus
        management resources. Oticon&#39;s commitment to empowering clinicians
        and patients in the realm of tinnitus management will be evident through
        this engaging and informative session.
