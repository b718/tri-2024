        <b>Abstract:</b> Traditional evidence-based approaches have so far
        failed to develop any FDA or CE approved treatments after many years of
        tinnitus research. Thus, a new strategy is required.

        Can we learn from the concept of war to develop better tinnitus
        treatments? In combined arms warfare the complementary strengths of the
        air force, ground troops and navy are used in concert to exert a maximal
        effect. Translating combined arms tactics to tinnitus we should adapt a
        multimodal approach. This means combining different ways to attack
        tinnitus, a combination of auditory, pharmacological, neuromodulatory,
        and psychology approaches, rather than limiting oneself to a unimodal
        approach. And within each modality multiple approaches may be combined,
        for example medication cocktails, hearing aids plus sound therapy,
        electrical stimulation combined with magnetic plus light-based
        neuromodulation. The pharmacological approach has been proven highly
        successful in fighting AIDS. By using 4 different drugs that each work
        on a different mechanism survival has increased from 5 years with 1
        drug, to 20 years with 2, 40 with 3 and a normal life expectancy with 4
        drugs.

        The war on tinnitus concept leads to many novel multimodal treatment
        possibilities that need to be explored scientifically and clinically, in
        order to finally silence tinnitus.
