# TRI-2024 Front-End

This is the front-end part of the project for TRI2024 conference. It is made entirely using TS + React.

The official website is [here](https://www.tri2024.com/).

# Hardest Part Of Project

The hardest part of the project so far is the back-end which involves storing the information of attendees and accepting the payment requests of the front-end. This is not my first time working with API's or MongoDB but the documentation took much longer than my past Spotify projects to understand and than implement. The project has come along well so-far!
